# trackit

This addon allows players with a simple command to create a macro to target and make an on-hit spell of his class. (Only shaman and mage atm)

TrackIt is interesting when you have to wait for a mob to respawn and you are surrounded by other players or simply to find a rare mob and be sure to be the first to hit it.


Commands : 

/ti [mobName]
or
/trackit [mobName]

 

How to use it :

First do /ti [mobName], then do a /m to get the macro and put it in your spell bar, once done, it will update every time you call the /ti command

 

/!\ Only for french atm, it will be updated soon
