# trackit

This addon allows players with a simple command to create a macro to target and make an on-hit spell of his class.

TrackIt is interesting when you have to wait for a mob to respawn and you are surrounded by other players or simply to find a rare mob and be sure to be the first to hit it.


Commands : 

/ti [mobName]
or
/trackit [mobName]

 
How to use it :

First do /ti [mobName], then do a /m to get the macro and put it in your spell bar, once done, it will update every time you call the /ti command
If you haven't learned the spell and/or don't have enough mana, your character will do an auto attack.

Spells :
  - Shaman : Earth Shock
  - Mage : Fire Blast
  - Rogue : Sinister Strike
  - Druid : Moonfire
  - Warrior : Heroic Strike
  - Paladin : Judgement
  - Warlock : Drain Soul
  - Hunter : Raptor Strike
  - Priest : Mind Flay

If you think other spells would be better, send me a MP.
